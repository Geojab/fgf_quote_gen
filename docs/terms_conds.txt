Bookings & Payments:
In order to secure Field Good Flowers Ltd services and reserve your wedding date, a non-refundable deposit of 30% of your total quoted amount is required along with this signed contract. The remaining balance is due no later than 30 days before the wedding. If the balance is not paid by this date, Field Good Flowers Ltd reserves the right to cancel services, with no refund of the deposit. Payment may be made via bank transfer.

Design Revisions:
Additions, subtractions, and small changes can be made up to 30 days prior to your wedding. Changes requested less than 30 days before the event may not be possible, as floral orders and preparation may already be underway; however, Field Good Flowers Ltd will make every effort to accommodate your needs.

Please note that any changes may affect the total cost. Increases will be invoiced separately and must be paid in advance. Reductions in scope or quantity may not result in a price decrease of more than 20% below the originally agreed quotation. This reflects time, planning, and product commitments already made in preparation for your event.

If you need to change the date of your event, Field Good Flowers Ltd attempt to accommodate you, however, this will be based on the availability of the date and materials.
